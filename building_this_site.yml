# to develop this site on any given computer, the correct packages need
# to be installed (see requirements.txt for details)
#
# this file will set up an anaconda environment that works. to do that,
# open anaconda powershell, or terminal (Mac) and run (one time only)
# 
#   conda env create --file building_this_site.yml
#
# To edit website files locally, I usually have a terminal open with 
# my base/working conda environment, and that terminal opens jupyterlab, etc.
# to create/modify existing pages. Then I open a SECOND terminal, and in 
# that second terminal:
#
#   switch to our new env:      conda activate LDSF_site
#   move cd to website's dir:   cd <ledatascifi-2022>
#
# When I want to see how the website looks, I build the website for 
# local viewing: by:
#
#   (Sometimes) Delete the existing `LeDataSciFi-2022/_build/` directory
#   run: jupyter-book build ./ 
# 
# A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in the `_build/html/` 
# folder. The terminal will give you a path to open that file in the browser.
# (Simply copy-and-paste it into the URL box.)
#
# All files inside the content folder will get rendered as webpages, but to 
# add them to the table of contents/navigation sidebar, you'll need to edit 
# _toc.yml as well.
