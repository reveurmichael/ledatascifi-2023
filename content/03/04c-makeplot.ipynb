    "To start plotting, add these to your import statements at the top of your file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",

    "1. **Start with simple graphs**, and then build in and layer on \"complications\" and features.\n",
    "2. **Really** compare your code with the syntax in the documentation. **Understanding what each parameters does and needs is essential.**\n",
    "3. Triple check for typos, unclosed parentheses and the like\n",
    "4. [What chart should I use (with `sns` examples)](https://www.data-to-viz.com) and more help on [how can I make it](https://python-graph-gallery.com)\n",

    "## Syntax tips\n",
    "\n",
    "With `seaborn`, I usually use this syntax that looks something like for graphing. (Delete the \"<\" and \">\" and replace the inside with what you need.) Obviously, you'll see many examples in this chapter that deviate from this. Usually this is because you don't need to explicitly declare \"data\", or because \"x\" is just assumed as all variables in the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.<function>(data = <dataframe> [optional data functions],\n",
    "               x = '<varname>', y = '<varname>',  \n",

    "```\n",

    ":class: tip\n",
    "1. Sometimes I add  `.query()` after the dataframe name to filter outliers\n",
    "2. Sometimes I add `.sample()` afterwards to plot a more manageable amount of data. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "sns.boxplot(data=ccm.query('td_a < 1 & td_a > 0'),\n",
    "            x='td_a')\n",

    "Generally, to plot in Python:\n",
    "1. Put your data into a DataFrame\n",
    "2. Format the data [long](02b_pandasVocab.html#the-shape-of-data) if you want to use a `sns` function\n",
    "3. Use `pd` or `sns` plotting functions.\n",
    "    - Q: Which? A: Which ever is easiest! `panda`'s plotting functions are simple and good for early stage and some simple graphics (bar, \"barh\", scatter, and density), but `seaborn` has many more built in options, has simpler syntax, and is easier to use, IMO.\n",
    "    - **Start with basic plots, then layer in features**\n",
    "    - Get the \"gist\" of the figure right\n",
    "4. If you need to customize the figure, you'll end up using `matplotlib` commands after the main plot function. Matplotlib is a full-powered (but confusing as heck) graphing package. In fact, both `pandas` and `seaborn` are just using `matplotlib`, but they hide the gory details for us. Thanks, `seaborn`!\n",
    "    - [This page](04f-betterplots) discusses customizing and improving figures\n",
    "    - **Only customize when necessary for hyper control. Focus on CONTENT** over hyper-control of formatting. \n",
    "    - Some \"format\" tweaks (add a title, change the axis titles) and choices about plotting can be quick/cheap and have high value, and you should do these **right before you finish your project/assignment** and are about to post it officially. Otherwise, focus on content.\n"
