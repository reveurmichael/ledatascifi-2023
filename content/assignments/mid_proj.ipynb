    "## Project Set Up\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuts and bolts of the set up are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic question: What \"types\" of firms were hurt more or less by covid?\n",
    "- Specific questions: What risk factors were associated with better/worse stock returns around the onset of covid?\n",
    "    - This is called a \"cross-sectional event study\"\n",
    "    - Expected minimum output: Scatterplot (x = some \"risk factors\", y = returns around March 2020) with regression lines; formatted well\n",
    "    - Discussion of the economics linking the your risk factors to the returns is expected\n",
    "    - Pro output: Regression tables, heatmaps, better scatterplots \n",
    "- New data science technique: Textual analysis. We will estimate \"risk factors\" from the text of S&P 500 firm's 10-K filings. \n",
    "    - More on this below\n",
    "- Data needed:\n",
    "    - Returns: Stock returns for S&P 500 firms can be pulled from Yahoo\n",
    "    - Risk factors for each firm will be created from their 10-K filings. \n",
    "    \n",
    "So your main challenge... is to create variables that measure risks for each firm. \n",
    "  \n",
    "        \n",
    "## Steps to complete the assignment\n",
    "    \n",
    "```{dropdown} 1. Start the assignment \n",
    "\n",
    "- As usual, click the link I provide in the discussion board. \n",
    "- But unlike before, the repo will be essentially empty. This is a start to finish project, so I'm letting you dictate the structure of the files.\n",
    "- Clone this to your computer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} 2. Edit **.gitignore** \n",
    "\n",
    "The `download_text_files.ipynb` file will create a large data structure in a subfolder called `10k_files/` with all the downloaded 10-K files. There will be several gigs of data in this folder. We don't want to save/push all these files to github!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "So add this directory (`10k_files/`) to your gitignore before you proceed!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "````{dropdown} 3. Create **download_text_files.ipynb** \n",
    "\n",
    "This file \n",
    "1. Should create a subfolder for inputs (`inputs/`). You should probably save the S&P500 list from the wikipedia page there.  \n",
    "1. Should create another subfolder (`text_files/`) to hold all the text files you download. Because scraping can generate large amounts of files, I usually put it in a dedicated input folder instead of the generic input folder we just made.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips/recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Try to download just one 10-K at first. When you can successfully do that, try a few more, one at a time. Check the folders on your computer - did they download like you expected? Are the files correct? If yes, continue. If not, you have an error to fix. \n",
    "1. The website has really good info on \"building a spider.\" Highly recommend! \n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "When you are confident the program works, \n",
    "1. Delete your whole `text_files/` and `input/` subfolders on your computer so you have a \"fresh start\" \n",
    "2. Rerun this from scratch. \n",
    "3. Rerun the file AGAIN (but don't delete the files you have). Does the file work after it's already been run, or partially completed it's work? Real spiders have to resume where they left off. You might need to make some conditional tweaks to the file to account for this. You don't want the code to actually re-download the data, but the code should still run without error!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} 4. IMPORTANT: Create **screenshot.png**\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not polite to upload so much data to GitHub. It takes up space on the server, and your collaborators/peer reviewers will have to download them all when they clone your repo. \n",
    "\n",
    "That's why you edited the gitignore before doing all those downloads. If you did it correctly and check Github Desktop, you won't see any of the text files!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now that your `download_text_files.ipynb` is done running, push the repo. Even though your _computer_ has a `/text_files/*` folder on it with many files and some hard drive space used, the repo in your browser doesn't show this at all! Good job!\n",
    "2. **Create `screenshot.png`. The purpose of this is to upload proof of the files for your reviewers.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Right click your `text_files` folder so it shows the number of files inside of it, and take a screenshot showing this. Save it as `screenshot.png` inside your repo. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} 5. Download **near_regex.py** from the community codebook into your repo\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be used in the next step.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The basic idea is to measure risks by counting the number of times a given risk topic is discussed in the 10-K.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file (broad steps)\n",
    "1. Creates an `output/` folder \n",
    "1. Loads the initial dataset of sample firms saved inside of `input/`.\n",
    "1. For each firm, load the corresponding 10-K and create (at least) 5 different risk measures, and save those new measurements to each of 5 new variables in that row. \n",
    "    1. **Pick one risk type, and think of three ways to measure it.** For example, there are many ways you could try to measure \"antitrust risk\", so come up with 3 different ways to measure it from the text. You can try different terms, different combinations of terms, different limits on how close terms need to be, and more. Comparing these different ways might help you understand how your choices can improve or hurt the value of your measurement. \n",
    "    2. **Pick a second risk type and create a single measure for it** (you only need to do one measurement on this risk type, but you can do more)\n",
    "    3. **Pick a third risk type and create a single measure for it** (again, you only need to do one, but you can do more)\n",
    "    4. Bonus measures - interesting variables you could also measure:\n",
    "        - The total length of the document (# of words)\n",
    "        - The # of unique words (similar to total length)\n",
    "        - The \"tone\" of the document\n",
    "2. Downloads 2019 accounting data (**2019 ccm_cleaned.dta**) from the data folder in the class repo on S&P500 firms (possibly useful in analysis) and adds them to the dataset \n",
    "1. Save the whole thing to `output/sp500_accting_plus_textrisks.csv`\n",

    "    - How were they measured? (Mechanical description)\n",
    "    - Why did you choose them and what do you hope they capture? (Economic reasoning)\n",
    "    - What are their statistical properties? (Do you have values for most/all firms, they should have variation within them, are they correlated with any accounting measures)\n",
    "1. **Validation checks and discussion of the risk measurements** **This step (validating the measurement) is very important in production quality analysis!***\n",
    "    - Discuss briefly whether these measurements are likely \"valid\" in the sense they capture what you hope.  \n",
    "    - Present some evidence they do capture your hopes. There are many ways to do this, and depend on the data you have and the risks you're measuring. \n",
    "        - You might print out a few examples of matches.\n",
    "        - One option is to show sentences that will correctly be caught by the search, and correctly not caught. And how easy is it for your search to find a sentence that matches the search but shouldn't.. (Hopefully: not too easy!) How easy is it for your search to miss a sentence that it should match...\n",

    "    - This includes summary stats,the number of firms, and other things EDA would turn up\n",
    "    - Are there any caveats about the sample and/or data? If so, mention them and briefly discuss possible issues they raise with the analysis. \n",
    "1. Explore the correlation between your risk values and stock returns around key dates for the onset of covid. \n",
    "    - Stock returns are in the class's data folder (\"2019-2020-stock_rets cleaned.zip\")\n",
    "    - Get the firm's returns for the week of Mar 9 - Mar 13, 2020 (the cumulative return for the week)\n",
    "    - Bonus: repeat the analysis but use the cumulative returns from Feb 23-Mar 23 as the \"collapse period\"\n",
    "    - Bonus: repeat the analysis but use Mar 24 as the \"stimmy day\" (stimulus was announced) ... how does this change your results, and is it doing so in a predictable way?\n",
    "    - Bonus: repeat the analysis, but use firm accounting variables: Some of these probably indicate that a firm should be more [resilient to the crisis](https://privpapers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3597838)! \n",
    "    - Present your findings visually and follow the lessons on effective visualization!\n",
    "    - You should write brief summaries of your findings.    \n",
    "1. Bonus: Explore the risk-return relationship, but use regressions so that you can control for firm traits and market returns. Does this change your results? \n",
    "    - Don't worry about printing these regressions out \"pretty\", just try them if you want!\n",
    "1. Bonus: Use **alpha** as y, not returns, in your plots and/or regressions. This will likely change the results. \n",
    "    - Step 1: Separately, for each firm, [estimate the beta and factor loadings](https://ledatascifi.github.io/ledatascifi-2022/content/05/05c_factorloadings.html) of each firm's returns in **2019**. Save that data.\n",
    "    - Step 2: For firm i on date t, alpha(i,t) = ret(i,t) - beta(of firm i)*mkt_return(t) - SMB(of firm i)*SMB_port_ret(t) - HML(of firm i)*HML_port_ret(t)\n",
    "        - _SMB_port_ret(t) is the return on the SMB portfolio on date t, which you can get from the Fama-French datasets!_\n",

    "- In other words: You will be graded on how much this looks like a professional report. Just \"dumping\" endless printouts is not as valuable as well-tailored tables and figures. High quality and concise reporting is an A1 emphasis. **Here, pretty, smart, and effective tables and visualizations will receive higher grades.** \n",
