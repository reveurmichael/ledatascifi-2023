# How to do peer review

After assignments are submitted, 
- You will be added to two classmate's assignment repos. Go to [github.com](www.github.com). On the left side of the page, under repositories, you'll see that you have access to assignments for two peers. 
- Inside the assignment repos, there will be an answer key along with instructions for how you submit your reviews. 

The peer reviews you do will be graded based on:
- Did you actually run the code to verify accuracy? (We do random audits to see if the code works.)
- Your review should be accurate and honest 
- Did you give helpful, constructive, and nice feedback? (Looking for professionalism + community!)
