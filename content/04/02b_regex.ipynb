    "The best ways to learn and use regex are:\n",
    "1. [https://regexone.com/](https://regexone.com) is so good, I'm loath to add anything else to this page.\n",
    "2. The [official python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) and its [HOWTO page](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html)\n",
    "3. Google+stackoverflow. If someone has done something similar, and found a solution, great!\n",

    "A: Look for all the instances of this pattern: (###) ###-####.\n",
