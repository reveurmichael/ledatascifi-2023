    "The objective of this chapter is to put the principles from [the last chapter](03_ML) into practice. We will use `sklearn`, the go-to package for machine learning in python. Go ahead and just bookmark its [user guide right now](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html), you'll be visiting it a lot. \n",
