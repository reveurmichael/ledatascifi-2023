    "# Sharing large files \n",
    "\n",
    "_This is a \"guest lecture\" from Harry Hawkes. I've modified it slightly in some places. Thanks, Harry!_\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",

    "Professor Bowen asked me to share my solution for sharing large files with your group or future users of the programs written for the final project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The solution I found was to upload the (compressed) files to your Lehigh Google Drive and then group members can download from Google Drive in the program.** \n",
    "\n",
    "This works well if your data is from multiple sources or sources that require an API because you only need to visit those sources once. It also helps because everyone doesn't need to keep such large files on their computers, and compressing the files speeds up the download times.\n",
    "\n",
    "_PROF: For projects where you only load the big data files one time, and then shrink the data to manageable sizes for analysis, it makes sense to save the analysis-ready files to your shared GitHub repo that rests on everyone's computer to ensure your analysis always starts from the same point, and everyone can work on the analysis while skipping the data construction steps._\n",
    "\n",
    "### The solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to complete the process:\n",
    "1. Upload (compressed) files to Lehigh Google Drive. (A non-Lehigh google drive will work too, but has limitations on space.)\n",
    "2. Turn on sharing for the file by right clicking it and selecting get shareable link, but you don't need to give edit access.\n",
    "3. Turn on sharing for users outside of Lehigh University - you don't need to give edit access. This makes your project more widely usable.\n",
    "4. Copy the function below ([or in the community codebook](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2022/tree/main/community_codebook)) into the repo you're working in as a file called \"download_file_from_google_drive.py\".\n",
    "5. Get the ID from the sharing link (found at the end of the sharing URL) - you'll need to put that into your code.\n",
    "1. In your file that uses this data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    from download_file_from_google_drive import download_file_from_google_drive\n",
    "\n",
    "    # download the file to your computer if you haven't already\n",
    "\n",
    "    filepath_to_download_to = 'my_big_file.csv' # replace with your preferred name/path\n",
    "    if not os.path.exists(filepath_to_download_to)\n",
    "        download_file_from_google_drive(\n",
    "            <put the ID here>, \n",
    "            filepath_to_download_to)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # open it\n",
