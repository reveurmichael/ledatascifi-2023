    "Modeling (applying data science techniques to our finance problems) is that on steroids. Instead of needing to figure out how to writing code to solve a discrete problem (reshape the data to our analysis level, add a variable to our dataset), we need _to figure out what to do._\n",

    "A few times a year, I get asked to be a judge of student statistical projects in politics or sports. While the students are very bright, **they spend WAY too much time using fancy statistical methods and not enough time framing the right questions and contextualizing their answers.** If you want to be a good data scientist, you should spend ~49% of your time developing your statistical intuition (i.e. how to ask good questions of the data), and ~49% of your time on domain knowledge (improving overall understanding of your field). **Only ~2% on methods per se.** \n",

    "Most analyses fall into one of two camps, based on the type of question:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tabbed} 1. **Questions about RELATIONSHIPS between variables**\n",
    "Example: Do airline closures affect how VCs monitor portfolio companies? \n",
    "- Direction matters: Is the relationship _positive, negative, or neither?_ \n",
    "- Magnitude of the relationship usually matters (which factors matter most?)\n",
    "- Is the relationship because one causes the other, or is it a correlation reflecting something else?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: You'll probably start with regression or logit\n",

    "\n",
    "```{tabbed} 1. 2. **Questions about PREDICTING some outcome variable**\n",
    "Example: Which loans will default? \n",
    "- Which factors matter and by how much, and in what ways are not as important\n",
    "\n",
    "Model: Probably something more complex (depends on question)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why should I think about the type of question?\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of question is a good thing to fix in your head, because it dictates what you care about when you pick and estimate your models. \n",
    "1. Suppose you have two variables, $y$ and $X$.\n",
    "1. You run a regression on it. That regression models the data as $y = m+\\beta*X$. \n",
    "1. The regression produces an estimate for m and $\\beta$, and I'll call the estimates versions $\\hat{m}$ and $\\hat{\\beta}$. (I add the hats to denote that these are estimates, and because choosing weird notation to confuse undergrads is in all faculty contracts.)\n",
    "1. You can also use the estimates to create predicted values for y, which I'll call $\\hat{y}$ and the formula to get them is $\\hat{y}=\\hat{m}+\\hat{\\beta}*X$. That is, you take all the _**real**_ values of X, and multiply by $\\hat{\\beta}$, and then add $\\hat{m}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, do you care about $\\hat{\\beta}$, or $\\hat{y}$? It depends on the type of your question!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{tip}\n",
    "- Relationship questions are $\\hat{\\beta}$ questions\n",

    "```{admonition} **A model is an idealized representation of a system**\n",

    "1. Select a model. (For example: find the \"center\" of a univariate distribution, regression, logistic)\n",
    "    - Use knowledge about the domain area of the question to help pick the model\n",
    "2. Select a loss function. (For example: Mean squared error, mean absolute deviation, R2)\n",
    "    - There are many loss functions!\n",
    "    - The loss function choice affects the accuracy and speed of estimation\n",
    "    - Choice depends on the estimation task\n",
    "    - Qualitative or quantitative data?\n",
    "    - Are all errors equal? (A false negative on a cancer test is much worse than a false positive!)\n",
    "    - Do outliers matter more or less? \n",
    "    - Some models often imply the loss function. For example, regression's loss function is almost always Mean Squared Error. \n",
