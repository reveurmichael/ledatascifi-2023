    "Collaborative coding is so essential to the process of solving interesting finance problems, that it underlies the [objectives](../about/objectives) at the front of this website. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This page is focused on helping your teams attack the project in the most effective way.** And it includes a few things that will push your existing GitHub comfort level up and make your team more productive. \n",

    "- How did you decide to approach the collaboration on this project? (The questions below)\n",
    "- Please let me know what issues/problems your group runs into\n",
    "- What solutions did you try? Did they work well or only barely or not at all?\n",
    "- Flip side: If your group has an easy time, or finds something that works well, please let me and your classmates know! \n",

    "\n",
    "A: It's up to you! Be entrepreneurial and run your group as you all see fit. (WhatsApp, groupme, google doc, zoom, skype...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown} **Q: How should you approach working concurrently on the project?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A: You basically have three approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequentially divide tasks and conquer, e.g. Person A does part 1, Person B does part 2 after A is done. \n",
    "    - _I.e. in asgn-05 we had three files: download_wiki, measure_risk, and analysis. You can split up your project in a similar fashion._\n",
    "    - Main advantages: Specialization + this \"gives ownership\" to one person for each part\n",
    "2. Co-work on a task simultaneously: Persons A and B do a zoom share meeting and co code on person A's computer via screen share + remote control. Advantage: More brainpower, and good when the whole group is stuck. \n",
    "3. Separately attack the same task, then combine your answers: Persons A and B separately do part 1, and compare answers/approach, and put together a finalized solution to part 1. This creates duplicate and discarded work product, but will generate more ideas on getting to the solution. \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{dropdown}  **Q: How do we work in the project repo \"at the same time\"?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue is that two people might make conflicting changes. E.g., Johnny added a line to `data.py` but Cindy deleted a line from `data.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: You have, basically, two approaches, and you might use both at different points of the project:\n",
    "1. **Free-for-all approach.** _Everyone works in the \"master\" branch of the repo all the time. This is what your default instinct might be. It can work, but you will probably have to fix merge conflicts to proceed at some point._\n",
    "1. **The \"branching\" approach.** _Basically, you create a clone of the \"master\" branch to work on, and when you've finished your changes, you create a \"pull request\" where you ask the main project's owner (you and your own team, in this case) to pull your branch's changes into the master branch. See the demo video below._\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning} Warning! Warning! Warning! \n",
    "\n",
    "**FOLLOW THE [GITHUB WORKFLOW RULES](../01/03a_githubworkflow.html) EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU WORK ON CODE OR DO ANYTHING IN THE REPO**\n",
    "1. BEFORE YOU START ANY WORK FOR THE DAY: Go to GH Desktop and \"Fetch/Pull\" origin\n",
    "2. WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH A WORKING SESSION: Clear your code, rerun all, save file, then push to cloud\n",
    "    \n",
    "If you forget to fetch/pull before you start (and someone made a change on the github repo since you last synced), or if someone is working at the same time (and pushes a change to the github repo that conflicts with a change you made), you are likely to receive a \"Merge Conflict\" notification from GH Desktop.\n",

    ":class: tip\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your most experienced coder might be given \"CEO\" status over the repo and \"leads the way\" on pull requests and gives guidance on merge conflicts.\n",
    "1. Follow the golden rules in [Chapter 2](../02/10_Golden_1.html). It is all about tips to make building a project less painful, more productive, and more rewarding.\n",
    "2. For example: Instead of putting the entire project in one ipynb file, structure the project like the midterm assignment: \n",
    "    - One code file to download each input needed, \n",
    "    - One code file to parse/transform each input, \n",
    "    - One \"get_all_data\" code file that, if executed, would run all files above\n",
    "    - One code to build the analysis sample, explore it, and analyze it \n",
    "3. It's better to over communicate than under communicate, especially in our virtual world\n",
