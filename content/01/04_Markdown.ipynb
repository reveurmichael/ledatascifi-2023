    "Copy the resources below to somewhere handy in your class notes folder for quick reference, or bookmark those links. (Or, both!)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all of the work in class will involve writing python files (.ipynb \"notebooks\") and readmes. Any text you type in a readme or a notebook file is, by default, just plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a just way to give text in a readme or notebook formatting. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using markdown in README files\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub automatically shows the readme on every repo with formatted markdown: \n",
    "- Scroll down and look at the readme for [this repo](https://github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2022) or [this repo](09_gitignore). You can see that there is bolded and italics text, code, hyperlinks and headers for sectioning. There is a lot more you can do with Markdown, but that will give you a taste. \n",
    "- [This is the raw version of how that readme/how that file looks _before_ Github formats it nicely.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2022/main/README.md) \n",
    "- Compare the raw version to the formatted version. See how I added the hyperlink in the second sentence?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using markdown in notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work in Jupyter, we will write python code in files called python notebooks (`ipynb` files, for \"IPYthon NoteBooks\"). In these `ipynb` files, we can have python code interspersed with sections of markdown text. As a result, we can write code and analysis that is easy to follow and execute. In other words, `ipynb` files are useful to create code that is [reproducible, reusable, and shareable](../about/objectives).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll recommend four resources to practice and learn markdown. Look at them all quickly, and you'll have the gist in under 15 minutes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [A very good markdown tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) \n",
    "2. [A good cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet)\n",
    "3. [Github's markdown explainer](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n",
    "4. Google \"How do I \\<do something \\> in markdown?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "`````{tabbed} What I type\n",
    "````text\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to make sections, subsections, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "One \"#\" at the start of a line makes a \"title header\". Two \"##\" means a section header, three a subsection, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bold and italics\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, **to make this phrase bold**, I add two asterisks before and after it.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Putting an underscore at the start and end of a phrase makes italics._ Easy!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lists, hyperlinks, and showing code\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make lists with hyphens:\n",
    "- If you want text to look like code, put it inside two backticks: `print(\"hello world\")`\n",
    "- Or, if the code is multiple lines (a \"code block\"), put it inside three backticks:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the \"python\" i put on the line above tells markdown that this code black\n",
    "# should use python syntax highlighting\n",
    "print(\"hello world\")\n",
    "print(\"why hello to you!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make numbered lists easily:\n",
    "1. Put brackets and parentheses back-to-back\n",
    "2. Put the text you want in the brackets\n",
    "3. And the link in the parentheses\n",
    "4. [Like this](https://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401282781)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Including pictures\n",
