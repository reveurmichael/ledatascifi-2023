## Using these recipes

The easiest option is to copy-paste them into the top of programs you write, but there are more "elegant" ways. 

If you are up for a tiny challenge, here is one slightly more elegant option: 
1. Suppose you're working on `asgn4.py`. 
2. Copy `eda.py` into the folder you're working on
3. In the section with your import statements, add `from eda import insufficient_but_starting_eda`
4. You can now use that function in your program!

The generic syntax is `from <name of file> import <function>`. Make sure you spell the name of the file and functions **exactly** correct (capitalization matters!).

## Bug fixes, feature improvements, and new recipe suggestions are "participation" for the purposes of grades 

We will put any functions or recipes we develop here, when we find ourselves doing stuff repeatedly.

The recipes and functions should be considered "under development". If you have ideas to improve or fix these functions, my _suggestion_ \* for submitting them is:
1. Work on the proposed file in your own `class notes/codebook` folder.
2. When you are done, come to this page in your browser (github.com/LeDataSciFi/ledatascifi-2021/community_codebook) and click "Add file".

\*Advanced GH users would probably prefer an approach using a "fork". But that can bring up issues I'd rather avoid.
